# Transformer-Oil-DGA-Dataset-with-Gaussian-Copula-Augmentation
Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) transformer oil dataset with Gaussian Copula augmentation for fault diagnosis research.

This repository contains **only synthetic (augmented) Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) data** of transformer insulating oil.  
The augmented data were generated using the **Gaussian Copula approach** based on statistical patterns derived from the IEC TC 10 standard database.  
**No original IEC TC 10 data are included in this repository.**

## 📘 Description
- **Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA):** A diagnostic technique for monitoring transformer health by measuring gases dissolved in insulating oil.
- **Gaussian Copula Augmentation:** A statistical method for modeling dependencies among variables and creating synthetic data that follow the original data distribution.
- **Data Source:** Statistical properties were inferred from the IEC TC 10 database, but the original data are not included here.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `augmented_data/` : Synthetic data generated using the Gaussian Copula model  
- `metadata/` : Additional information on variables and dataset structure
